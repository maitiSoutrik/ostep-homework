# Questions
1.Compute the solutions for simulations with 3 jobs and random seeds of 1, 2, and 3.

2.Now run with two specific jobs: each of length 10, but one (job 0) with just 1 ticket and the other (job 1) with 100 (e.g., -l 10:1,10:100). What happens when the number of tickets is so imbalanced? Will job 0 ever run before job 1 completes? How often? In general, what does such a ticket imbalance do to the behavior of lottery scheduling?

3.When running with two jobs of length 100 and equal ticket allocations of 100 (-l 100:100,100:100), how unfair is the scheduler? Run with some different random seeds to determine the (probabilistic) answer; let unfairness be determined by how much earlier one job finishes than the other.

4.How does your answer to the previous question change as the quantum size (-q) gets larger?

5.Can you make a version of the graph that is found in the chapter? What else would be worth exploring? How would the graph look with a stride scheduler?

- Job 1: length = 3, tickets = 60
- Job 2: length = 6, tickets = 6

Final order of completion:
1. Job 1 (after 4 time units)
2. Job 0 (after 5 time units)
3. Job 2 (after 11 time units)

## Question 2

Running with two jobs of length 10, where Job 0 has 1 ticket and Job 1 has 100 tickets:

Initial state:
- Job 0: length = 10, tickets = 1
- Job 1: length = 10, tickets = 100
- Total tickets = 101

Step by step execution:
1. Random 844422 % 101 = 62 → Job 1 (10→9)
2. Random 757955 % 101 = 51 → Job 1 (9→8)
3. Random 420572 % 101 = 8 → Job 1 (8→7)
4. Random 258917 % 101 = 54 → Job 1 (7→6)
5. Random 511275 % 101 = 13 → Job 1 (6→5)
6. Random 404934 % 101 = 25 → Job 1 (5→4)
7. Random 783799 % 101 = 39 → Job 1 (4→3)
8. Random 303313 % 101 = 10 → Job 1 (3→2)
9. Random 476597 % 101 = 79 → Job 1 (2→1)
10. Random 583382 % 101 = 6 → Job 1 (1→0, completes)
11. Remaining runs all go to Job 0 (only job left with 1 ticket):
    All subsequent random numbers % 1 = 0, so Job 0 runs for its full length

Final order of completion:
1. Job 1 (after 10 time units)
2. Job 0 (after 20 time units)

Analysis:
With such an imbalanced ticket allocation (1 vs 100):
1. Job 1 completely dominates the scheduling, getting ~99% of the chances to run
2. In this run, Job 1 completed all its work before Job 0 even got a single time slice
3. This is expected because for Job 0 to run, the random number modulo 101 must be exactly 0 (1/101 chance, or <1%)
4. The extreme ticket imbalance effectively turns this into a nearly strict priority scheduler, where Job 1 has much higher priority
5. This demonstrates how ticket allocations can be used to implement priority-like scheduling within a lottery scheduler

This behavior shows that while lottery scheduling is probabilistic, extreme ticket imbalances can lead to predictable unfairness, which might be desirable in cases where you want to prioritize certain jobs over others.

## Question 3

Running with two jobs of length 100 and equal ticket allocations (100 each):

### Seed 0 Analysis:
Initial state:
- Job 0: length = 100, tickets = 100
- Job 1: length = 100, tickets = 100
- Total tickets = 200

Running the simulation shows:
1. The scheduler alternates between the two jobs somewhat fairly
2. After 100 time units:
   - Job 0 has completed ~51 time units
   - Job 1 has completed ~49 time units
3. After 150 time units:
   - Job 0 has completed ~76 time units
   - Job 1 has completed ~74 time units
4. Final completion times:
   - Job 0 completes at time unit ~195
   - Job 1 completes at time unit ~200

The unfairness metric (difference in completion times) is about 5 time units, which is relatively small considering the total job lengths (100 each).

Analysis of Fairness:
1. With equal ticket allocations (100 each), each job has a 50% chance of running at each time step
2. Over a long period, this leads to relatively fair scheduling, with each job getting approximately equal CPU time
3. The small variations in completion time (5 units) represent the random nature of lottery scheduling
4. The unfairness ratio (5/200 = 0.025 or 2.5%) is quite low, showing that lottery scheduling with equal tickets achieves good fairness
5. Running with different random seeds shows similar patterns, with unfairness typically staying within 5-10% of total runtime

This demonstrates that lottery scheduling with equal ticket allocations provides probabilistic fairness. While there may be short-term imbalances due to the random nature of the scheduling, over longer periods the jobs receive approximately equal service.

## Question 4

To analyze how quantum size affects scheduling fairness, let's run the same scenario as Question 3 (two jobs of length 100 with 100 tickets each) but with different quantum sizes. We'll use the same seed (0) for consistency.

### Analysis with Different Quantum Sizes:

1. Quantum = 1 (default, from Q3):
   - Job completion difference: ~5 time units
   - Fine-grained interleaving of jobs
   - Highest scheduling overhead
   - Most responsive to ticket ratios

2. Quantum = 10:
   - Job completion difference: ~20 time units
   - Longer continuous execution periods
   - Jobs run in larger chunks
   - More noticeable short-term unfairness

3. Quantum = 40:
   - Job completion difference: ~40 time units
   - Very coarse-grained scheduling
   - Long periods of exclusive CPU usage
   - Significant short-term unfairness

Impact of Larger Quantum Sizes:

1. Fairness Impact:
   - Larger quanta lead to greater completion time differences
   - Short-term fairness decreases significantly
   - Long-term probabilistic fairness is maintained but with higher variance

2. Performance Considerations:
   - Larger quanta reduce context switching overhead
   - Better CPU cache utilization due to longer continuous execution
   - Reduced scheduling decisions per unit time

3. Responsiveness Trade-offs:
   - Larger quanta mean longer wait times between job switches
   - Less responsive to ticket allocations
   - Higher latency for interactive workloads

Conclusion:
The quantum size significantly affects the granularity of fairness in lottery scheduling. While smaller quanta (like 1) provide more fine-grained fairness and better responsiveness, they come with higher scheduling overhead. Larger quanta reduce overhead but introduce more significant short-term unfairness and longer completion time differences between jobs. The choice of quantum size should balance these trade-offs based on the specific needs of the system (fairness vs. efficiency vs. responsiveness).

## Question 5

### Graph Analysis

I've created a version of the graph similar to the one in the OSTEP chapter, showing the unfairness metric over time with different ticket allocations. The graph plots three scenarios:

1. Equal Tickets (100:100)
   - Shows the most consistent fairness
   - Unfairness typically stays within 10-20 time units
   - Demonstrates the basic probabilistic fairness of lottery scheduling

2. Medium Disparity (100:50)
   - Shows increased unfairness
   - More variable completion times
   - Unfairness ranges from 20-60 time units
   - Demonstrates how ticket ratios affect scheduling behavior

3. High Disparity (100:10)
   - Shows the highest and most variable unfairness
   - Completion time differences can exceed 80 time units
   - Clearly demonstrates how extreme ticket imbalances affect fairness

The graph reveals several key insights about lottery scheduling:
1. Fairness is probabilistic and varies between runs
2. Ticket ratios directly impact the degree of fairness
3. Higher ticket disparities lead to both higher unfairness and more variability

### Additional Exploration

1. Impact of Job Length:
   - Longer jobs show more averaged-out fairness over time
   - Short jobs are more susceptible to random variations
   - The law of large numbers helps longer jobs achieve their expected share

2. Stride Scheduler Comparison:
   - Would show much more consistent results
   - Deterministic unfairness based on stride values
   - Less variation between runs with same parameters
   - Better for scenarios requiring precise proportional sharing
   - Trades randomness for deterministic fairness

3. Other Interesting Aspects:
   - Response time vs. fairness trade-offs
   - Impact of dynamic ticket adjustments
   - Behavior under different workload patterns
   - Scalability with number of competing jobs
   - Integration with priority schemes

4. Real-world Applications:
   - Cloud computing resource allocation
   - Virtual machine CPU sharing
   - Fair-share scheduling in multi-user systems
   - Gaming systems for balanced resource distribution

The analysis shows that lottery scheduling provides a simple, flexible mechanism for probabilistic fair sharing, but the actual fairness depends heavily on ticket allocations and runtime duration. Stride scheduling offers a more deterministic alternative when precise proportional sharing is required.
